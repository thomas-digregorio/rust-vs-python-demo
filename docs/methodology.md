# Methodology

## Fairness controls in current implementation

- Fixed random seed for Monte Carlo in both languages.
- Same sample count and record counts in both languages.
- Shared schema validation for merged output.

## Next steps

- Expand to remaining benchmark matrix categories.
- Add repeated runs and p50/p95 summaries.
- Capture memory and CPU telemetry per benchmark run.
